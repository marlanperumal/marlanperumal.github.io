Hi, I'm Marlan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a former Mechancial Engineer, Lecturer, Consultant and Technology Manager.
I'm taking a year off, primarily to cement my mostly self-taught knowledge of software development by focussing on fundamentals and practice.

I'll do this by building a new project each month, learning a couple new technologies as required, and trying to figure out and implement best practice on the technologies I'm already familiar with.

In an attempt to learn out loud, I'll be documenting my learnings here. I'll also attempt to republish them on Medium, dev.to and the like, with a few tweets (or whatever the X equivalent is now) thrown in.

If you like what I'm doing please give me a shout on one of the social links at the foot.
